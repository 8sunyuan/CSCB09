a) How does the following function in C find the side of the array parameter

void f(int *p)
{
    ...
}

Not possible. No way to know if you are end of array. Sizeof definitely does
not work. p is simply a pointer to an int. Can't get size of array out of pointer.

b) Under what circumstances would the answer to part (a) be different if the parameter were of type "char *"?

If we consider it a string then there will be a zero byte with '\0'.
