1. Create linked list with node for each process
   First node has pid of -1
    -call this front
   Set empty = 1;

2. run all  child processes at once
    if (respawn)
      Insert pid and command string
        //curr = insert(pid, command, curr);
      if (empty) {
        empty = 0;
      }

3. If empty return
  wait for child process




Part 2: After setting all initial processes we have to wait for the respawns

Check PID, Is it in list?
  No? go back thru loop. This happens for "once" processes that are finished

  Yes? that means its respawn
    FORK();
      ERROR: handle
      Child: Go thru list, get command, remove node from List
      Parent: Change id



Final Submit:
  1. p2myinit.c
      shows all echo PROCESSES, needs to check all run levels in string
  2. test.c
      checks all run levels in string(not tested).
        update- doesn't work.
