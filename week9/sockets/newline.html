<h1>Newline conventions and internet communications</h1>

A text file is a sequence of zero or more "lines".
A line of a text file is a sequence of zero or more non-newline characters
followed by a newline.

<h3> What's a newline? </h3>

<p>
Different operating systems have different newline "conventions".
The ASCII character standard says that if you are going to
use a single byte to separate lines, you should use byte number 10, which we
also call "control-J", or "line feed" or "LF".
Using this single character
is the newline convention for unix,
so in unix we often simply call this byte value the "newline character", and
we get it in C in unix by typing "\n".

<p>
MS-Windows uses a two-byte sequence to separate lines in a
text file.
The original ASCII standard actually says that this is preferred;
and it was common in the 1970s and earlier.  (I think that this preference for a
two-byte sequence is unfortunate, and that it's helpful that unix uses a
single byte.)
These two bytes are what we
could call "control-M" and "control-J".  "Control-M" is also known as
"carriage return" or "CR".  Together, this two byte sequence is called "CRLF".

<p>
Some other operating systems have other newline conventions.

<p>
These differing newline conventions present an interoperability problem.
You may have had a problem at some time in your life with
transferring files from MS-Windows to unix, such that your file
ends up with a bunch of ^Ms in it on unix.
You'll have this whenever you transfer a file between this combination of
operating system types
without performing a newline conversion between the MS-Windows newline
sequence and the unix newline sequence.  Such a conversion is often a
feature of file transfer programs... but it <i>must</i> be optional because it
would make a mess of non-text files.

<h3> How do we make the <i>inter</i>net interoperable? </h3>

If dissimilar computers are to be able to communicate over the internet,
the data transmitted over the internet must not be machine-type-specific.
That is, if we intend to transmit the same data from a unix machine and from a
CRLF-using machine, those two transmissions must be the same sequence
of bytes.

<p>
In the case of transmitting data which we consider to be integers,
we need to standardize on the byte order.
The standard network byte order is big-endian; a "little-endian" machine must
swap bytes in integers when copying them to and from network transmission
buffers.
This is discussed in the textbook.

<p>
In the case of transmitting text, the ASCII standard gives us standard
byte values for just about everything <i>except</i> newlines.
So we need to adopt a newline standard for network text transmission.
(This is not discussed in the textbook; it seems to me that it's an omission.)

<p>
The way in which you encode the newline concept in bytes is called a newline
"convention".
Just as we have a network byte order, we have a network newline convention.

<p>
The network newline convention is CRLF.
That is, a newline is represented by the two bytes (in order) which we could
call CR and LF, or control-M and control-J, or 13 and 10, or \015 and \012.

<h3> How do we write C code to specify a CRLF? </h3>

<p>
In unix, \n means LF.  (In MS-Windows, \n should expand to the two characters ^M
and ^J, by the time it gets written to a file on disk, although the C standard
requires it
to seem to be a single character to your C program.)
<br>
Also, in unix you can use \r for CR.  So we can write the network newline
convention in a string in unix as \r\n.  This is, then, a unix-specific
encoding of this purposefully-non-unix-specific network newline sequence.

<p>
In general in C, we could write "\015\012".
This is then not unix-specific.
However, your assignment four is probably already unix-specific in more
substantial ways than this, and it's fine to write "\r\n" in your assignment
four, in my opinion.
I think that "\r\n" is the usual way this is written in unix network
communication programs.
On the other hand, it's certainly at least as good to write "\015\012"
instead (if not better).

<p>
The "network newline convention" is the rule that you convert <i>to</i> the
network newline convention upon transmission (e.g. in unix you put ^Ms before
all ^Js) and that you convert <i>from</i> the network newline convention upon
receipt (e.g. in unix you either ignore all ^Ms, or treat them the same as
^Js if blank lines don't matter, or do the more thorough operation of
converting all CRLF pairs to just LF).
